                        As you explore the works in my collections you could be forgiven
                        for thinking them the works of a madman desparately clinging on to sanity 
                        through the explorations of his subconscious, hoping that one of these works 
                        will show him the path back to a sound mind. 
                        <br></br>
                        This is incorrect; I have completely left my sanity behind and am currently on a journey through insanity.
                        The works you will find in my collections are not the brief flashes of lucidity in an otherwise fractured psyche. 
                        They are the documentations of what lies in the murky abyss, the disjointed fragments of possibilities realized and yet to manifest. 
                        Perhaps one more sane than i can piece these works into a cohesive whole. 
                        Could it be you?
